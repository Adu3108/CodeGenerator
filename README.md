This repository contains the project done as a part of CS626: Speech and Natural Language Processing and the Web at IIT Bombay in Autumn 2022.

## Problem Statement

This project aims to parse natural language descriptions written in a regional Indian Languages into source code written in a general-purpose programming language like Python. We will tackle this problem by first translating the regional Indian language into English language (multilingual machine translation) and then proceeding with code generation using this English language description.
